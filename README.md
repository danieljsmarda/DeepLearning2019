# DeepLearning2019
This repository contains the code for the two projects that were part of the Deep Learning course EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland) by Professor Francois Fleuret. For detailed READMEs about the individual projects, please look in the individual project folders. 

In the first project we build and compare the performances of several neural network architectures using PyTorch. We have a simple CNN, a CNN with weight sharing, and a CNN that leverages weight sharing and auxiliary tasks.

In the second project we build a bare-bones deep learning framework using only Python and PyTorch tensors (without any further PyTorch abstractions). In other words, we manually implement loss functions and modules to construct a sequential linear neural network.
